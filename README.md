A tool for easily managing multiple python virtual environments. I grew sick and tired of dealing with all 
the nonsense of working with virtual environments, trying to remember what each one did and trying to keep track
of each project's dependencies. This project is designed to try to solve one of the biggest headaches in Python 
and make it a simple process.

#### Feature List
- Create new environments or add existing environments to a handy list.
- Enter any environment as desired, regardless if you remember where it is or not.
- View all your environments and see at a glance which version of Python it's using.
- Manage and easily remove unused environments.

#### Quality TBD:
- MAJOR code cleanup. (It's functional, but the codebase is incredibly ugly)
- Improve TUI.

##### Features TDB:
- Implement simple backup system to save and restore the state of an environment.
- Add terminal interface for automated CLI usage.
- Add option to display an environment's installed dependencies.
- Add option to dump an environment's dependencies to a requirement.txt file.
